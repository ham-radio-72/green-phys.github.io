The Non-Crossing approximation ([Keiter and Kimball, PRL 25, 672
(1970)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.25.672)) and the
one-crossing approximation ([Pruschke, Z. Phys. B 74, 439
(1989)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01311391)) are standard
approximations to the hybridization expansion that work well in
insulating (or almost insulating) systems. Here is a talk by Lei on the
approximation

[boldNCA and

[inchworm](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.266802)
methods are closely related but numerically exact methods for sampling
the hybridization expansion.
