The Prony Analytic Continuation method is described in detail in
the following paper:

https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10576

Green provides a pedagogical implementation of the method as it was submitted to the journal. The implementation is generic; follow the instructions in the Readme to get started. A more elaborate version that seamlessly integrates with the GREEN code will be presented at a later time.

To get started, head to the repository at:

https://github.com/Green-Phys/PronyAC

then follow the instructions in the readme. File [issues](https://github.com/Green-Phys/PronyAC/issues) and ask [Lei Zhang](mailto:lzphy@umich.edu), [Sergei Iskakov](mailto:siskakov@umich.edu) or [Emanuel Gull](mailto:egull@umich.edu)
